### about

**brot** is a C++ graphics engine designed for quick iteration on ideas and straightforward code. It's inspired by what I feel is a lack of anything as simple to use as pygame/pyglet/LÃ–VE/etc. 

It is _not_ a fully-fledged game engine and never will be, but one could be written on top of it.

### philosophy

**brot** is built on the latest C++ standard, taking advantage of ultra-modern language features. This isn't to say that there is no code that couldn't be written better than I have, but I try and use a modern style wherever I can.

This project is intended primarily as a fun toy for me to play around with, I anticipate things will break/crash/explode wildly. If you check this repo out and notice something is broken, feel free to create an issue, and if/when I have time I will try and get to it.

There is no guarantee I will not completely break old code either, the API will likely never be considered stable.
